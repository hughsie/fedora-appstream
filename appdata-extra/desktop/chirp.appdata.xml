		CHIRP is a free, open-source tool for programming your amateur radio. It supports a large number of
		manufacturers and models, as well as provides a way to interface with multiple data sources and formats.
		You can use CHIRP to, for example, download memory channels from your radio, update them, and then
		upload them to the radio, either by performing a clone operation, or one memory at a time in live mode.
		Besides radiop-specific formats, files can also be converted to and from CSV and ARRL TravelPlus.
		</p>
		<p>Some of the supported manufacturers include AnyTone, Alinco, Baofeng, Baojie, Icom, Intek, Jetstream, 
		Kenwood, KYD, Puxing, TYT, Yaesu and Wouxun.</p>

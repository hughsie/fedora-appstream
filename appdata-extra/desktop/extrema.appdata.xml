<p>All the power and flexibility of Extrema's versatile command language is now available from its rich graphical user interface.</p>

<p>Although Extrema's command language is already known for its intuitive syntax and ease of use, the graphical user interface simplifies the process even further, by displaying all the options available. No need to remember how to get that obscure special effect you need; just click the button and it's done!

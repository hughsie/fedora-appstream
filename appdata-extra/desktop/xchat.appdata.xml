XChat is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client.
It allows you to join multiple IRC channels at the same time, which you can view
and browse using tabs or a tree-like interface.
You can use XChat to publicly chat with people in a channel, and to have private
one-on-one conversations.
You can even transfer files with XChat!

The client includes nick completion, alerts for mentions, logging functionality,
and several customization options for fonts, sounds and colors.

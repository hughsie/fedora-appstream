          A meta-app over the other packaging apps; the best place to find out
          what is in the Fedora repositories. Which packages are present in
          which version, who is maintaining them, what patches have been
          applied, what bugs have been reported against them. All these kind of
          questions can be answered here. It is sometimes called "Fedora
          Community v2" after the old Fedora Community site.
